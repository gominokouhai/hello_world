# hello_world
Just following the tutorial to make sure I know what I'm doing.

So I'm supposed to write sth abt myself here. Well, I'm just zis guy, you know? I studied coding at university but never got into it professionally, so now I do a little bit of hacking every now and then, just to keep my hand in. The coding landscape has changed a great deal since my university days, so I'mma enjoy learning about things like IDEs and languages that aren't purposely designed to make one suffer.
